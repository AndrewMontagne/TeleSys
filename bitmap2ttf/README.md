Bitmap2ttf converts (monochrome) bitmap fonts into ttf fonts.

There are three parts:

- outliner.py:

    Traces each bitmap into a series of polygons.

- convert.py:

    Makes the polygons into svg files, and writes a script for font forge
    to convert the svgs into a ttf font.

- loader of your choice/implementation:

    - pcftotty.py:

        Loader for PCF bitmap fonts. 
        Usage: `pcftottf font.pcf font.ttf`

    - amigatottf.py
    
        Loader for amiga diskfonts (eg topaz).
        Usage: `amigatottf topaz/11 topaz.ttf`
        Amiga diskfonts are multiple files in a directory. 
        The output will be named after the directory.

    - Something else
    
        The program is structured to make it easy to implement a loader
        for a font format of your choice. Define a click command to load
        the font, wrap it with `@converter` and make it return a tuple
        containing `(glyphs, ascent, descent)` where `glyphs` is a dict
        of `{codepoint: bitmap}` mappings.


Scaling

When a ttf font is displayed at a certain size, that size is the vertical
size from the top of the tallest character to the bottom of the lowest
descender. It is not usually possible to set the character width independently.

Assuming a fixed font with character bitmaps 20 tall and 12 wide, then
the resulting ttf should be set to 20px height. It will then be 12px wide
and the strokes will exactly line up to screen pixels. (Assuming device
pixel ratio is 1, but that is a whole other matter.)

However, there is a problem: many bitmap fonts are not designed for
square pixels. There are two situations where this is important:

1. When the font is designed for a half-height progressive screen mode
like 720x256. In a screen mode like this the pixels are twice as tall
as they are wide. When displayed on a modern computer they will appear
vertically squashed. This is easy to fix - just double the vertical
size of each character shape before conversions.

2. When the font is designed for a display system that doesn't use exactly
square pixels, such as PAL. In the PAL format, pixels are around 1.2 to 1.333
times wider than they are tall. Fonts like this will appear narrower than
they should on a modern PC. This can also be fixed by scaling the character
shapes. However, because the scaling factor is not an integer this leads
to a problem: suppose the character is 20x12 and you scale the width by 1.2.
1.2 * 12 = 14.4. Now the character won't fit horizontally on the pixel grid
when it is displayed at 20 pixels tall. This causes aliasing which makes
the font look bad. There isn't really any solution for this - you have
to choose whether you want the font to have pixel perfect outlines, or
whether a particular body of text should have the right aspect ratio.
Depending on the font renderer and intended purpose of the font, you
might get better results with one or the other.

The bitmap2ttf converters accept a horizontal and vertical scaling
factor in the `--xscale` and `--yscale` options. Note however that only
the ratio between them is important. A font will always be displayed
20px tall and with the horizontal width scaled to match regardless of
its internal dimensions. So scaling 2x in both directions will have no
visible effect on the resulting font.
